React Job interview 2 hour Code Challenge


I was tasked with creating an app based on the following requirements :
    Clone this challenge into a private repo.

    Code has to be written in React.js with functional components using React Hooks (UseState, UseEffect).

    The home page of your app shows a list of all available users to select.

    You should be able to filter through those users via an input on the same page, filter by their username for example.

    You should be able to click on a user in the list. When a user is clicked, you should be redirected to a page that shows further details about the user.
    
    Please do not use any libraries for styling (Material UI, Chakra UI, Bootstrap) As this is a front-end challenge, we'd like to see your styling skill as well!
